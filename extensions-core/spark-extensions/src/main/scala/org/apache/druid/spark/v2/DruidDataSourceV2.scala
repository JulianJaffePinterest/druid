  /**
    * Create a writer to save a dataframe as a Druid table. Spark knows the partitioning information
    * for the dataframe, but won't share. Something like the DateBucketAndHashPartitioner from the
    * druid-spark-batch GitHub project can be used to ensure that all partitions have only one time
    * bucket they're responsible for while also setting a soft upper bound on the maximum size of a
    * segment. Otherwise, multiple indexing segments may be stored in memory, causing memory
    * pressure, and segments may contain up to the number of rows in a partition. We can't construct
    * multiple partitions for the same segment interval in a single DruidDataWriter because we can't
    * be sure we won't chose a partition number that isn't also being used for the same interval by
    * a separate DruidDataWriter.
    *
    * Additionally, while the caller knows how many partitions there are total for each segment, we
    * don't, and so the caller will need to provide the total number of partitions if necessary for
    * the desired shard spec (e.g. Numbered or HashedNumbered). Otherwise, we'll have to default to
    * a partition count of 1 in the shard spec, meaning that Numbered will degrade to Linear and
    * users won't have atomic loading of segments within an interval.
    *
    * To work around this, users can provide a broadcast map from (Spark) partition id to the
    * partition num and total partition count for the segment
    *
    * TODO: This may actually be bigger problem. Partition ids may not be contiguous for all segments
    *  in a bucket unless callers are meticulous about partitioning, in which case almost all shard
    *  specs will consider the output incomplete.
