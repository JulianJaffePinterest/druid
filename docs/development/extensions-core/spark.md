# Apache Spark Reader and Writer for Druid

## Reader
The reader reads Druid segments from deep storage into Spark. It locates the segments to read and determines their
schema if not provided by querying the brokers for the relevant metadata but otherwise does not interact with a running
Druid cluster.

Sample Code:
```scala
val metadataProperties = Map[String, String](
  "metadataDbType" -> "mysql",
  "metadataConnectUri" -> "jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid",
  "metadataUser" -> "druid",
  "metadataPassword" -> "diurd"
)

sparkSession
  .read
  .format("druid")
  .options(Map[String, String]("table" -> "dataSource") ++ metadataProperties)
  .load()
```

If you know the schema of the Druid data source you're reading from, you can save needing to determine the schema via
calls to the broker with
```scala
sparkSession
  .read
  .format("druid")
  .schema(schema)
  .options(Map[String, String]("table" -> "dataSource") ++ metadataProperties)
  .load()
```

Filters should be applied to the read-in data frame before any [Spark actions](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.5/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset)
are triggered, to allow predicates to be pushed down to the reader and avoid full scans of the underlying Druid data.

## Writer
The writer writes Druid segments directly to deep storage and then updates the Druid cluster's metadata, bypassing the
running cluster entirely.

Sample Code:
```scala
val metadataProperties = Map[String, String](
  "metadataDbType" -> "mysql",
  "metadataConnectUri" -> "jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid",
  "metadataUser" -> "druid",
  "metadataPassword" -> "diurd"
)

val writerConfigs = Map[String, String] (
  "table" -> "dataSource",
  "version" -> 1,
  "deepStorageType" -> "local",
  "storageDirectory" -> "/mnt/druid/druid-segments/"
)

df
  .write
  .format("druid")
  .mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)
  .options(Map[String, String](writerConfigs ++ metadataProperties))
  .save()
```

### Partitioning & `PartitionMap`s
The segments written by this writer are controlled by the calling DataFrame's internal partitioning.
If there are many small partitions, or the DataFrame's partitions span output intervals, then many
small Druid segments will be written with poor overall roll-up. If the DataFrame's partitions are
skewed, then the Druid segments produced will also be skewed. To avoid this, users should take
care to properly partition their DataFrames prior to calling `.write()`. Additionally, for some shard
specs such as `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` or `SingleDimensionShardSpec` which require a higher-level
view of the data than can be obtained from a partition, callers should pass along a `PartitionMap`
containing metadata for each Spark partition. This partition map can be serialized using the
`PartitionMapProvider.serializePartitionMap` and passed along with the writer options using the
`partitionMap` key. The partitioners in `org.apache.druid.spark.partitioners` can be used to partition
DataFrames and generate the corresponding `partitionMap` if necessary, but this is less efficient
than partitioning the DataFrame in the desired manner in the course of preparing the data.

If a "simpler" shard spec such as `NumberedShardSpec` or `LinearShardSpec` is used, a `partitionMap`
can be provided but is unnecessary unless the name of a segment's directory on deep storage should
match the segment's id exactly. The writer will rationalize shard specs within time chunks to
ensure data is atomically loaded in Druid. Either way, callers should still take care when partitioning DataFrames to
write to avoid ingesting skewed data or too many small segments.

## Plugin Registries and Druid Extension Support
One of Druid's strengths is its extensibility. Since these Spark readers and writers will not execute on a Druid cluster
and won't have the ability to dynamically load classes or integrate with Druid's Guice injectors, Druid extensions can't
be used directly. Instead, these connectors use a plugin registry architecture, including default plugins that support
most functionality in `extensions-core`. Custom plugins consisting of a string name and one or more serializable
generator functions must be registered before the first Spark action which would depend on them is called.

## Configuration Reference

### Metadata Client Configs
The properties used to configure the client that interacts with the Druid metadata server directly. Used by both reader
and the writer. The `metadataPassword` property can either be provided as a string that will be used as-is or can be
provided as a serialized PasswordProvider that will be resolved when the metadata client is first instantiated. If a
custom PasswordProvider is used, be sure to register the provider with the PasswordProviderRegistry before use.

|`reader.useCompactSketches`|Controls whether or not compact representations of complex metrics are used (only for metrics that support compact forms)|No|False|


### Writer Configs
The properties used to configure the DataSourceWriter when writing data to Druid from Spark. See the
[ingestion specs documentation](../../ingestion/index.md#ingestion-specs) for more details.

`writer.dimensions` may be either a comma-delimited list of column names _or_ a JSON list of Druid DimensionSchema
objects (i.e. the `dimensions` section of a `DimensionSpec`). If DimensionSchemas are provided, dimension types must
match the type of the corresponding Spark columns exactly. Otherwise, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.

Users can also specify properties to be passed along to the [IndexSpec](../../ingestion/index.md#indexspec). The
defaults will likely be more performant for most users.

|`indexSpec.metricCompression`|	Compression format for metric columns. Options are `lz4`, `lzf`, `uncompressed`, or `none` (which is more efficient than `uncompressed`, but not supported by older versions of Druid)|No|`lz4`|
|`indexSpec.longEncoding`|Encoding format for long-typed columns. Applies regardless of whether they are dimensions or metrics. Options are `auto` or `longs`. `auto` encodes the values using offset or lookup table depending on column cardinality, and store them with variable size. `longs` stores the value as-is with 8 bytes each|No|`longs`|

### Deep Storage Configs
The configuration properties used when interacting with deep storage systems directly. Only used in the writer. (The
reader interacts with deep storage as well, but for now operates purely off the metadata returned in segment LoadSpecs).

**Caution**: The Azure storage config doesn't work. Users will have to implement their own segment writers
and register them with the SegmentWriterRegistry (and hopefully contribute them back to this warning can be removed! :))

|`s3.disableChunkedEncoding`|Whether or not to disable chunked encoding| |False| <!-- Keeping the irritating inconsistency in property naming here to match the S3 extension names -->
|`s3.enablePathStyleAccess`|Whether or not to enable path-style access| |False|
|`s3.forceGlobalBucketAccessEnabled`|Whether or not to force global bucket access| |False|

#### Custom Deep Storage Implementations

The Spark-Druid extension includes support for writing segments to the above deep storage options. If you want to write
to a different deep storage option or use a different implementation for one of the options above, you can implement and
register a plugin with the SegmentWriterRegistry. Any properties specified in the options map specified in the `write()`
call will be passed along to the plugin functions.
